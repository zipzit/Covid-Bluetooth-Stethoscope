---Overview---------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope:
    We're looking for a functional stethoscope that a doctor can use to listen
    to a patient's vitals, while wearing full protective gear.  A stethoscope on
    a hose is clumsy, not helpful with protective gear (facemask, hooded garment);
    additionally its ackward to disinfect a stethoscope between patients.  An ideal
    solution would be a device that could be wrapped in a disposable covering (perhaps
    a rubber glove?) between patients.

    Screw it.. Github for the win.

---stupid dumb question for team - Stereo ?-------------------------------------

    LBC note: I was looking at the spec sheet for the AdaFruit MEMS microphone.
    You can use two for stereo.  Wow.  We each have two ears.  Is there any advantage
    to the quality of stethoscope use by providing true stereo performance?
    Perhaps an oval shaped cone? That would increase power usage, but it might
    be a big improvement in the quality of the device's output (?)

    I only have one microphone chip, a AdaFruit Mems development board (I2S)
    I'm going to check my buddies stock & steal (er, borrow) what he has available.
    He thinks he may have some electret condenser microphone elements available.
    I'm pretty sure he has a huge quantity of resistors and capacitors for most needs.

---Listening to heart rate---------------------------------------------------------

    oops.  Heart rate isn't our primary objective.. its listening to a patient's
    lungs.

    Electret vs mems?
    https://forum.digikey.com/t/electret-condenser-ecm-vs-mems-microphone/447
    Electret condenser microphone (ECM microphone) apply the principle of capacitor
    charge/discharge for operation. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor,
    the vibration is generated due to the sound, then produce the changes of
    charge between the plates to make the signal transmission.

    Since the vibration is purely an electromechanical mechanism, it has the
    whole acoustic frequency response (0-20kHZ) and low distortion in the signal
    transmission, generally used in external portable microphone. Its shortcoming
    is being unable to undertake a re-flow soldering, so there is a specific
    soldering process and tools for manual soldering.

---ESP-32-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Power Consumption?

    AA battery (1.5v) life: 2400 mAhours
    AAA battery: 1000 mAhours


    While executing WiFi.scanNetworks() function very first time, module consumes
    average current of 0.5A for 10 ms with four peaks of approx. 0.7A during that
    period.  After that module consumes average 130 mA with 0.6A current spikes.
    The spikes have duration of 0.5 ms and appear in bursts with spike rate of 100 ms.

    Apparently it is about 2 times worse than promised in the ESP-32 data sheet.
    I expected to see about 0.3A max (50 mA for CPU and 240 mA max for WiFi
    transmitter).

    Can ESP32 handle I2S?  Can it perform A to D?
    https://demo-dijiudu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html
    ESP32 contains two I2S peripherals. These peripherals can be configured to
    input and output sample data via the I2S driver.  The I2S peripheral supports
    DMA meaning it can stream sample data without requiring each sample to be
    read or written by the CPU.  I2S output can also be routed directly to the
    Digital/Analog Converter output channels (GPIO 25 & GPIO 26) to produce
    analog output directly, rather than via an external I2S codec.

    LBC note: After looking closely at some of these details, I cannot imagine
    WebBlueTooth will manage a decent audio stream.  too much data.

    Never mind that this discussion was for the remote Telemedicine out of scope
    proposal.   A doctor needs to use a stethoscope to manage tube insertions to
    a patient right in from of them.  this is not a telemedicine conversation.

    Free watch (cell phone, geo locator) for elders in need. Interesting, but
    doesn't fit our proposal.  Might be a contact when it comes time for manufacturing...

    SMS texting from Chatbox...
    could be nice, not needed here. Ha.  Lost your stethoscope, send a text page.
    Er... no. just no...

    I was actually looking for server space.. and with current project scope that's
    unnecessary.

---Blood Oxygen level measurement?----------------------------------------------

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry

    Not quite sure how to make one of these (either for finger or earlobe) that
    easy to disinfect between users.  That would be ugly.  Cheaper to buy a
    battery operated one, one per patient.  Review needed.

---High Tech Question-----------------------------------------------------------

    Once you've gone digital, are there other tools we're interested in?
    e.g. Digital Signal Processing including filtering, Frequency domain analysis?

    LBC Note: I've recently finished the Coursera class (Mar 2018)--
    Audio Signal Processing For Music Applications
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing
    https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ymusic0001-audio-signal-processing-music-applications

    Meghana... the code work was all done in Python!

    At the time I wanted to use raspberry pi microphone for an interactive dynamic
    outdoor art project in downtown Las Vegas.  I also got bashed hard at a
    hackathon for a mining project, using a microphone / pi system to monitor
    pending mineshaft pump failures.  Great idea, i didn't really understand the
    nuances of Fast Fourier Transforms for live monitoring.  The class was
    really good at forcing you to understand what's going on.

---BlueTooth Linkup-------------------------------------------------------------

    The topic started as a conversation with my research scientist buddy Dirk,
    do we really need a visible screen?  And it gets down to how do you pair
    a digital stethoscope with a Bluetooth headset, if neither of them has a
    visible screen.  What if you are in a location that has lots of other
    Bluetooth devices present?

    One way is to lock the devices together using a dedicated "mac" address.
    You can permanently link the headset to a particular Bluetooth stethoscope.
    Easy to do when you are just making one set, not so easy to do when you need
    fifty or a 1000 of these.  And then if permanently paired, what happens
    when there is a problem with either (expensive) device?  You have to throw
    both pieces away.

    I think that means a OLED display screen is required, to manage the Bluetooth
    pairing process, sigh.  And momentary buttons for up / down / select.

    An exceptional reference on this stuff?  (ESP32, IOT stuff, Bluetooth)
