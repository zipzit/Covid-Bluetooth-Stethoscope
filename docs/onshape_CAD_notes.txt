---Where do you ask questions about the software?-------------------------------

    https://forum.onshape.com/discussions

---How do you rotate an assembly?-----------------------------------------------

    I hate that I can't see the top of the part in the selection tree.
    e.g. the microphone board is stored upside down.

    Ans. When you import from SolidWorks, check the box to make Y axis up.
    See other notes below regarding importing content from Solidworks to OnShape

--How do you measure stuff?-----------------------------------------------------

    Where is the measuring tape icon?

    https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/measure-ps.htm

    The Onshape Measure tool is available in Part Studios, for sketches and parts,
    and in Assemblies for parts and assemblies. The Measure tool appears automatically
    in the bottom right corner of the interface after a selection is made in Part
    Studios or Assemblies, (shown below, in a screenshot from Onshape's desktop
    application).

    The Measure tool in Onshape, as opposed to other CAD systems, is an automatic
    action rather than a specific tool. Because it is not a selectable tool, you
    do not need to search in the toolbar in order to use it.

---WTF?-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    From the folder view, click on a part.

    Sometimes the part opens up as a 3D image.  Cool.

    Sometimes there is a popup box in text stating the part name,
    Parasolid File
    File size: X Mb
    uploaded date / time
    Update button, Download button

    How does that work?  Why does same action on a .x_t file result in two
    dramatically different responses?

    How do we get to the 3d view of the part?

    ans.  Turns out the upload of the file had a problem.  And when there
    is a problem that OnShape doesn't like, you get that text popup.  You have to
    watch the notifications.  There was one there that said
    "Translation completed with errors
    Speaker AS04004PR-R.x_t was translated with errors.
    The following 2 surface(s) failed validation and have been removed:
    2 unnamed - number of faults:8"

    The errors were in the original cad reference, but I don't see the errors
    at all in Solidworks.  I do note, conversion to .x_b is more resilient
    to the issue than .x_t files.

---Cut a section in a 3d part?--------------------------------------------------

    https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/6217/how-to-create-a-section-view-of-a-part
    To turn on section view you can click 'Turn section view on' in the view menu
    (the view menu is on the right side just below the axis indicators)

---How do you export a document from OnShape to local computer?-----------------

    https://www.onshape.com/cad-blog/import-export-onshape

    open the the part document. go to the bottom head tab.   right click, then export

---Import assemblies without losing mating relationships------------------------

    https://www.onshape.com/cad-blog/tech-tip-importing-assemblies

    Importing your assembly into Onshape is easy, but it’s very important to
    choose one of the supported formats that include the assembly as well as
    all the parts. This is important because with most CAD systems, the assembly
    file does not contain the parts. For an up-to-date list of supported formats,
    check out Onshape Help. At the time of this blog post, the supported file
    formats for importing assemblies are:
        Parasolid
        ACIS
        STEP
        IGES
        SolidWorks Pack and Go zip files
        JT
        Rhino
    These are formats that contain the assembly and all the parts in one file.
    To import your assembly into Onshape, simply click the “Import Document files”
    command from the Documents page and select the appropriate file.

    When importing, you have an option to import the assembly with the “Y Axis Up”
    (which is common in many traditional CAD systems), and the option to “Import
    file to Part Studios only” (flatten). This will import your assembly and all
    of its parts into a single Part Studio.

    One last note for SolidWorks users: To import a SolidWorks assembly, first
    use the Pack and Go command in SolidWorks and the option to “Save to Zip file.”

    Whoa..,. the Solidworks --> pack and go, save as .zip works really well.
    The assembly arrives with the pieces in the right location, but that's just
    temporary.  The mating relationships do NOT exist. When you grab the part
    to slide it to a different location, only individual parts translate.

    https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/2046/migrating-projects-from-solidworks-to-onshape-what-gets-lost-and-needs-fixing-by-hand
    It turns out that my file has hundreds of parts in it which are all in the
    right places, however each individual component pulls apart when I click and
    drag it rather than moving as a rigid assembly.  The assembly is missing all
    the mates.

    According to the Help feedback person: "Unfortunately the only system capable
    of fully reading in SolidWorks' mates is SolidWorks. We're exploring the
    ability to bring them in properly, but that functionality is a long way off."

    Ugh.  See note from philip_thomas.  this is way ugly. yeech.  bleeeeth. ouch.

    https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/3962/solidworks-assembly-import-organising-parts

    LBC note.  I wasted HOURS struggling with this stuff.

    1) uploading an assembly from SolidWorks loses all mating info.
    2) If you do the Pack & Go + other stuff, the info will arrive in OnShape with everything in the correct location.
    3) Pick the biggest part, fix it in location, then group everything to the fixed base.
       Fix and Group locks the component parts in place, good enough for govt work.
    4) And here is the important step.  In OnShape, when you import a subassembly,
    ensure that you are using the tab called Assemblies and NOT Part Studio
    (why that isn't the default is beyond me...)  If you import a subassembly
    while the Part Studio is highlighted all the components reset to center, a total mess.

---How do you update assemblies?------------------------------------------------

    Wow, they make this way easy.  There is a round blue button.
    "Update All References to the Latest Version"  Its on the upper left of the
    top menu bar.

---Imports?---------------------------------------------------------------------

    What is best format for importing references to Onshape?  Clearly
    xxx.SLDPRT format fails.

    e.g.
    aa_battery.SLDPRT failed to translate:
    Imported file contains no translatable geometry.   <--- Huh?

    https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/uploadfiles.htm
    https://cad.onshape.com/help/Content/translation.htm   <--- Start the journey here.

    Non-CAD files that are able to be imported into Onshape include:
        .pdf
        .mp4
        .png
        .jpg/jpeg
        .svg
        .gif
        .txt
        .md

    Onshape automatically imports and translates these CAD file formats for parts
    and assemblies, including wire bodies and sketch curves.

---How do you make an element translucent?--------------------------------------

    https://forum.onshape.com/discussion/4766/part-transparency

    You can make entire assembly transparent by selecting Translucent option
    (near navigation icon)

    Also you can make all parts other than one part transparent using Isolate
    option by right clicking on particular part

    To make one part transparent,you can change the transparency of particular
    part in part studio it self.

    you can change the transparency of the part in the parts studio and then it
    will also be transparent in the assembly. To edit the transparency of the
    part in the part studio, right-click on the part name or the part itself and
    select 'Edit appearance'.

---Having a terrible time working with assemblies-------------------------------

    --Items stored as fix, group assemblies, imported as assemblies, break into
      components during drag and drop operations. Ugh.
    --Planar mate doesn't seem to be working correctly.  it looks like two parts
      that mate can have one and only one mate command.  The Fastened mate is
      pretty handy, and there is no similar command in Solidworks. With a single
      mate, things are working okay.
    --Zoom all is way too hard to find.  Needs to be a top level Mouse click, NOT KEYSTROKE commands.
      Found it!  right click anywhere on the screen.  You get the choice of Isometric or Zoom to fit.
      Perfect.  My faith is restored. hallelujah..
    --The section revolve thing was not performed on the 16 oz cup, not sure why not.
