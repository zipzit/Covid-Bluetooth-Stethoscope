## Safety measures

Currently all work on the Covid-19 Bluetooth Stethoscope project is remote, with volunteers spread around the world working from their homes.  There are no physical spaces or assets associated with the project at this time.  If this changes, we can utilize the ICS 208 Site Safety and Control Plan.

If we acquire and distribute materials to makerspaces or volunteers we will take measures to minimize contact and package materials safely.


## Stethoscope designs

For stethoscope designs themselves, our primary safety concern is sanitation.  Our ideal solution is to have a durable, smooth-sided housing that is sealed and can be easily sanitized with current practices - commonly used disinfectants O3 and/or UV light.  If that isn't possible due to necessary openings like a speaker grill or rough 3D-printed material, then devices can be placed in a ziploc bag that can be sanitized or discarded between uses provided audio quality is sufficient. 

There is no case where a faulty device could harm the patient or provide a false reading for the medical professional.  Medical professionals are trained in stethoscope use and if a device fails or they cannot hear appropriate audio the fallback solution would be to use a standard stethoscope, so the worst-case option is equivalent to the current standard solution.
