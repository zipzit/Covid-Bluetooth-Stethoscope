## Organizational agreement

The agreement is that Ctrl-h will become an informal fiscal sponsor of the Covid-19 Bluetooth Stethoscope Project under their 501(c)(3) non-profit status.

The Covid-19 Bluetooth Stethoscope Project will become an official project of Ctrl-h.  Ctrl-h will hold the current funds allocated to the Stethoscope project, to be transferred over, and those funds will only be allocated for stethoscope project costs.  For disbursement, Stethoscope project coordinators will create and approve invoices that can be fulfilled by Ctrl-h administration.

Ctrl-h has agreed to this arrangement for one year free-of-charge, after which we will revert to a 5% administration fee, capped at 5% of current assets.  Over time as plans develop, if desired the Stethoscope project can organize as it's own non-profit corporation and we can move towards an official fiscal sponsorship arrangement registered with the state of Oregon.

The current grant agreement with Protocol Labs specifies that the Stethoscope project will give regular updates to Protocol Labs regarding the status of our project, and any designs and source code produced will be provided to the public under an open-source license.

The current project coordinators are:

Dr. Brian L\
Charley L\
L.B. C\
Aaron R\
Michael V

(Full contact information is provided in the Google spreadsheet)

My suggestion is that for the time being, invoice disbursements be approved by any three project coordinators.\
