---Overview---------------------------------------------------------------------

    https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/252-bluetooth-stethoscope-pulse-oximeter

Scope:
    We're looking for a functional stethoscope that a doctor can use to listen
    to a patient's vitals, while wearing full protective gear.  A stethoscope on
    a hose is clumsy, not helpful with protective gear (facemask, hooded garment);
    additionally its ackward to disinfect a stethoscope between patients.  An ideal
    solution would be a device that could be wrapped in a disposable covering (perhaps
    a rubber glove?) between patients.

---stupid dumb question for team - Stereo ?-------------------------------------

    LBC note: I was looking at the spec sheet for the AdaFruit MEMS microphone.
    You can use two for stereo.  Wow.  We each have two ears.  Is there any advantage
    to the quality of stethoscope use by providing true stereo performance?
    Perhaps an oval shaped cone? That would increase power usage, but it might
    be a big improvement in the quality of the device's output (?)

    I only have one microphone chip, a AdaFruit Mems development board (I2S)
    I'm going to check my buddies stock & steal (er, borrow) what he has available.
    He thinks he may have some electret condenser microphone elements available.
    I'm pretty sure he has a huge quantity of resistors and capacitors for most needs.

---Listening to heart rate---------------------------------------------------------

    https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/best-microphone-to-detect-heartbeat.155369/

    oops.  Heart rate isn't our primary objective.. its listening to a patient's
    lungs.

    Mike Vang's comment:
        Some of the boards out there like the MAX30100 can serve dual purpose such as
        getting SpO2 measurement and heart rate sensor.

        Including heart rate measurement is a feature that could always be adding if
        using something like a MAX30100 board.

---what about listening to lungs?-----------------------------------------------

    Electret vs mems?
    https://forum.digikey.com/t/electret-condenser-ecm-vs-mems-microphone/447
    Electret condenser microphone (ECM microphone) apply the principle of capacitor
    charge/discharge for operation. The diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor,
    the vibration is generated due to the sound, then produce the changes of
    charge between the plates to make the signal transmission.

    Since the vibration is purely an electromechanical mechanism, it has the
    whole acoustic frequency response (0-20kHZ) and low distortion in the signal
    transmission, generally used in external portable microphone. Its shortcoming
    is being unable to undertake a re-flow soldering, so there is a specific
    soldering process and tools for manual soldering.

    While executing WiFi.scanNetworks() function very first time, module consumes
    average current of 0.5A for 10 ms with four peaks of approx. 0.7A during that

    The spikes have duration of 0.5 ms and appear in bursts with spike rate of 100 ms.

    Apparently it is about 2 times worse than promised in the ESP-32 data sheet.
    I expected to see about 0.3A max (50 mA for CPU and 240 mA max for WiFi

    Can ESP32 handle I2S?  Can it perform A to D?
    https://demo-dijiudu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html
    ESP32 contains two I2S peripherals. These peripherals can be configured to
    input and output sample data via the I2S driver.  The I2S peripheral supports
    DMA meaning it can stream sample data without requiring each sample to be
    read or written by the CPU.  I2S output can also be routed directly to the
    Digital/Analog Converter output channels (GPIO 25 & GPIO 26) to produce
    analog output directly, rather than via an external I2S codec.

    Never mind that this discussion was for the remote Telemedicine out of scope
    proposal.   A doctor needs to use a stethoscope to manage tube insertions to
    a patient right in from of them.  this is not a telemedicine conversation.

---Blood Oxygen level measurement?----------------------------------------------

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry

    Reflective Mode:

    These are good articles/papers about reflective-mode oximetry:
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959516301205
    https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042413-160152/unrestricted/Final_MQP_Report.pdf

    I don't see any currently available commercial reflective-mode solutions though.
    This article:  https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81961664.pdf  (page 2) shows a prototype reflective-mode circuit.  This has a
     microcontroller but otherwise doesn't look very complicated, we could possibly prototype one.

    Transmissive Mode:

    Apparently fingertip-or-earlobe oximetry is "transmissive mode" oximetry.  "Reflective mode" oximetry is possible at the
    wrists, chest or other sites, so this could theoretically be integrated into a stethoscope puck. The hardware is likely different
    than current market solutions, more research is necessary.

     If transmissive mode (fingertip) sensors would work, it's cheaper to source battery-operated units, one per patient.
     They look difficult to sterilize though.

    I found this Maxim Max30100 pulse oximiter/heartrate module and a review:
      https://www.teachmemicro.com/max30100-arduino-heart-rate-sensor/

    There are a couple different board versions, one is cheaper but harder to work with.
    The more expensive one is about $6/unit on Alibaba, don't know about availability.

    Mike Vang's comment:
        One could combine an electronic stethoscope with an oximeter.

        The paper that is shared below says that a reflectory pulse oximeter has more
        diverse locations it could take like from the feet, head, chest and wrist.
        Accuracy becomes an issue though.

        Reflectory pulse oximeter's has two LED's on one side (red and infrared). I
        think that many pulse oximeter like the Max30100 is a reflectory pulse
        oximeter.

        But we run into an issue: the base that touches the client is enlarged to
        include both a stethoscope and a pulse oximeter.

---High Tech Question-----------------------------------------------------------

    Once you've gone digital, are there other tools we're interested in?
    e.g. Digital Signal Processing including filtering, Frequency domain analysis?

    LBC Note: I've recently finished the Coursera class (Mar 2018)--
    Audio Signal Processing For Music Applications
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing
    https://online.stanford.edu/courses/sohs-ymusic0001-audio-signal-processing-music-applications

    Meghana... the code work was all done in Python!

    At the time I wanted to use raspberry pi microphone for an interactive dynamic
    outdoor art project in downtown Las Vegas.  I also got bashed hard at a
    hackathon for a mining project, using a microphone / pi system to monitor
    pending mineshaft pump failures.  Great idea, i didn't really understand the
    nuances of Fast Fourier Transforms for live monitoring.  The class was
    really good at forcing you to understand what's going on.

---BlueTooth Linkup-------------------------------------------------------------

    The topic started as a conversation with my research scientist buddy Dirk,
    do we really need a visible screen?  And it gets down to how do you pair
    a digital stethoscope with a Bluetooth headset, if neither of them has a
    visible screen.  What if you are in a location that has lots of other
    Bluetooth devices present?

    One way is to lock the devices together using a dedicated "mac" address.
    You can permanently link the headset to a particular Bluetooth stethoscope.
    Easy to do when you are just making one set, not so easy to do when you need
    fifty or a 1000 of these.  And then if permanently paired, what happens
    when there is a problem with either (expensive) device?  You have to throw
    both pieces away.

    I think that means a OLED display screen is required, to manage the Bluetooth
    pairing process, sigh.  And momentary buttons for up / down / select.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram
    A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a
    signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms
    are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data
    is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

    INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL STETHOSCOPES AND ELECTRICAL COMPONENT SELECTION CRITERIA
    By: John DiCristina
        A stethoscope must be most sensitive to cardiac sound in the 20Hz to 400Hz
        range and to pulmonary sound in the 100Hz to 1200Hz range. Note that the
        frequency ranges vary by manufacturer, and the DSP algorithms filter out
        sound beyond these optimal ranges.

    Shuang Leng, Ru San Tan, Kevin Tshun Chuan Chai, Chao Wang, Dhanjoo Ghista,
    and Liang Zhongcorresponding author
        •• Thinklabs’ Rhythm 32 inventor, Clive Smith uses an electromagnetic diaphragm with
        a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to
        sound waves identically to a conventional acoustic stethoscope, with changes in an
        electric field replacing changes in air pressure. This preserves the sound of an acoustic
        stethoscope with the benefits of amplification

    The Stethoscope Gets a “Smart” IoT Upgrade -- Engineers at John Hopkins University
    integrate AI, acoustics, and noise-canceling technology to modernize this
    humble medical device.
    Carlos Gonzalez     FEB 19, 2019
        The smart scope has an external microphone that records ambient sounds.
        The system uses active and adaptive acoustics to remove those sounds, in
        real time, from the digitized audio signal transmitted to the users ears.

    https://www.worthview.com/stethoscope-amplify-sound/
    Most of the times the rubes are made of rubber or any material that can create
    multiple reflections for the sound wave. When the sound wave vibrates the
    flat surface, it is directed to the rubber tube of the stethoscope. Then,
    the wave reflects inside the tube and travel to the ear tips. The direction
    is important to give accurate sound. The quality of rubber will determine
    the quality of sound the doctor gets through the ear tips.

    The high-pitch sounds directly vibrate to the flat disc of the diaphragm.
    However, the low-pitch sound uses the inside wave reflection through the bell.
    It picks the sound from the artery’s movement and moves outward to vibrate
    the bell. Then, it is directed to the tube and thus, the sound is amplified.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stethoscope
    oops. --> Rappaport and Sprague designed a new stethoscope in the 1940s, which
    became the standard by which other stethoscopes are measured, consisting of
    two sides, one of which is used for the respiratory system, the other for the
    cardiovascular system  (LBC note, which bell is for which?)

    And this -->  The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is
    achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from
    ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used
    in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric
    crystal at the head of a metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact
    with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam
    behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 uses an
    electromagnetic diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive
    sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric
    field replacing changes in air pressure. The Eko Core enables wireless
    transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet.

    https://insidefirstaid.com/diagnosis/the-best-littman-stethoscope-master-cardiology-and-classic-comparison
    Bells work similarly to diaphragms, but the hollow cavity in a bell has no
    membrane across it. Traditionally bells are used to listen to low frequency
    sounds.

    Although many stethoscopes come with a bell, there is disagreement in the
    medical community whether bells are useful or obsolete. Bells are traditionally
    thought to be better for hearing low-frequency sounds like some heart murmurs
    and bowel sounds while diaphragms are better for high frequency murmurs and
    lung sounds

    See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinard_horn

    https://uberdoco.com/blogs/news/stethoscope-bell-vs-diaphragm-a-comprehensive-comparison
    The bell is highly sensitive to low-frequency sounds. These are easily picked
    on the skin surface of the person being examined. The Diaphragm is sensitive
    to both low and high-frequency sounds. However, it is designed to filter out
    low-frequency sounds making it more sensitive to high-frequency sounds. The
    high-frequency sounds are amplified as the waves vibrate against the stiff
    membrane. This allows accuracy and clarity in the transmission of sound from
    the chest piece to the tubing and finally into your ears.

---Thinklabs and Covid 19-------------------------------------------------------

    https://www.thinklabs.com/covid19
    https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-containment-dr-jon-lapook-60-minutes-2020-03-08/
    https://www.thinklabs.com/infectious-disease-and-biocontainment

    Biocontainment presents a unique challenge for auscultation. With the Centers
    for Disease Control calling for personal protective equipment (PPE) in treating
    patients for the coronavirus, how does the clinician place stethoscope eartips
    in the ears for listening? Auscultation at the bedside using a conventional
    style stethoscope with tubing becomes impossible.

    Thinklabs One's unique stethoscope design allows healthcare workers to perform
    ausculation while being protected in an isolation environment, and can be
    used with protective covers in the ED to reduce contamination when pre-screening
    admissions.

    The One can be used directly using earbuds or headphones, via bluetooth
    transmitters within the isolation room or to a consultant outside the room,
    connected to a loudspeaker, or send sounds via email or instant messaging on
    iPhone or iPad.

    PPE
    -Personnel are donning disposable earbud headphones inside PPE or headsets
     over PPE.
    -If inside, the earbud/headphone cable is then snaked out of the protective
     clothing, to be connected, external to the clothing, to the Thinklabs One
     Digital Stethoscope. The clinician can then listen clearly to patient sounds
     while being fully suited up.  (LBC notes...Ugh...  Really?  A bluetooth radio
     chip costs like $1.00 in production. Opinion: any manufacturer of anything
     with electrons, who doesn't include a bluetooth or wifi chip these days is
     dumb, if not just purely for marketing buzz and hype.)

    Ziploc Protection for Primary Care and ED
    -One group of researchers developed a simple and practical way to treat multiple
     infectious patients using resealable Ziploc plastic bags. They connected the
     stethoscope to a Bluetooth transmitter and then placed the device inside of
     up to ten-yes, ten-resealable Ziploc plastic bags. The bags were sequentially
     removed to reveal a clean surface for listening to patients.

    -The Ziploc method is a novel way to take advantage of the Thinklabs One form
     factor. The entire stethoscope and Bluetooth transmitter fit inside a sealed
     bag.

    -This is ideal for ED and primary care use, where protection is highly
     desirable, but PPE impractical.

    terms:
    ausculation - the action of listening to sounds from the heart, lungs, or
    other organs, typically with a stethoscope, as a part of medical diagnosis.

    digital stethoscope
    Adriano Ordoz Barissa (Cravinhos, Brazil)
    October 11th, 2017
    The idea for this product is to make a stethoscope easy to use in order to be
    used in hospitals and residences.  (LBC note.  I sent a note to Adriano thru
    grabcad, asking for input, perhaps get him to join team. 3/29/2020, 4:30PM PST)

---Idea-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ESP32 devices have multiple wireless Inputs/output systems.  We could use
    bluetooth for heart/lungs audio, and use an other channel for battery life
    monitoring (I'm thinking a hospital has 20 of these things.. How many have low
    batteries?)  LoRa band can easily handle that little bit of IoT (internet of things)
    traffic, reminding hospital folks that units 1, 9 and 13 are running low and need
    to be charged...

---Volume adjustment, Analog Design---------------------------------------------

    Oops. Missed this first time thru.  In the AdaFruit data sheet for the
    audio amp, there is a note on pg. 8 of 15
    "For volume control, a dual 50K audio taper pot can be wired in series
    with the inputs as shown"

    ref: AdaFruit audio amp 3w dev board uses MAX98306 chip.pdf

    Obviously with a mono speaker in/out we don't really need the dual pots.
    Search criteria at Digikey:  in Stock, Logarithmetic, value 50K, sort by price.
    But wait.. I do see some pots that include an on/off switch built in.  Either
    push on/off or rotate to power off. That would help us greatly.  Need a bit more
    research here.  In the meantime I have access to linear 50K pots that will work
    in testing until phase 2 delivery of parts from Digikey...

    What about a dual on off switch and potentiometer?  That would be nice to have.
    https://www.digikey.com/products/en/potentiometers-variable-resistors/rotary-potentiometers-rheostats/84
    search criteria: In Stock, Resistance 35K to 75K,
    Switch:  Push Push, Rotary, Detent (Avoid Push Pull, avoid Momentary)

    Something is definitely amiss here.  All the digikey logarithmetic variable
    pots that include on/off switches are 10K ohms. All the old school audio
    amplification circults using opamps reference 10K ohm log pots. Not sure why
    Lady Ada recommended the 50K pots. It would SURE BE HANDY on the low end
    system to have an integrated on/off/volume single knob.  I know we talked about
    always on and that is certainly an option.  We really need to test this stuff.

    My tendency is to purchase some switch 10K pots, a 25K pot, a 50K pot and a 100K pot and
    see what makes sense after we power up the original prototype.  Its not at all
    clear on how this will sound. Lets try it and see.  Extra parts go back into
    the bin for next project.

    Closed/Open Loop:  (huh?)
    Open Loop -- The output assumes one of the two possible states, that is +V(sat)
         or -V(sat) and the amplifier acts as a switch only. This is used in
         rare applications like voltage comparator, zero crossing detector, etc..
         The op-amp works as a high gain amplifier.
    Closed Loop -- The utility of an op-amp can be greatly increased by providing
        negative feedback.  The output in this case is not driven into saturation
        and the circuit behaves in a linear manner.

    ELECTRET MICROPHONE AMPLIFIER - MAX4466 WITH ADJUSTABLE GAIN
    20-20KHz electret microphone
    This is a convenient package with some interesting features. Worth understanding,
    On the back, we include a small trimmer pot to adjust the gain. You can set
    the gain from 25x to 125x. That's down to be about 200mVpp (for normal speaking
    volume about 6" away) which is good for attaching to something that expects
    'line level' input without clipping, or up to about 1Vpp, ideal for reading
    from a microcontroller ADC. The output is rail-to-rail so if the sounds gets
    loud, the output can go up to 5Vpp!

    Using it is simple: connect GND to ground, VCC to 2.4-5VDC. For the best
    performance, use the "quietest" supply available (on an Arduino, this would
    be the 3.3V supply). The audio waveform will come out of the OUT pin. The
    output will have a DC bias of VCC/2 so when its perfectly quiet, the voltage
    will be a steady VCC/2 volts (it is DC coupled). If the audio equipment you're
    using requires AC coupled audio, place a 100uF capacitor between the output
    pin and the input of your device. If you're connecting to an audio amplifier
    that has differential inputs or includes decoupling capacitors, the 100uF cap
    is not required.  The output pin is not designed to drive speakers or anything
    but the smallest in-ear headphones - you'll need an audio amplifier (such as
    our 3.7W stereo amp) if you want to connect the amp directly to speakers.
    If you're connecting to a microcontroller pin, you don't need an amplifier
    or decoupling capacitor - connect the OUT pin directly to the microcontroller
    ADC pin.

    I started here for the quick and dirty easy to solder and test microphone boards
    with components already attached.  My initial thought was to obtain one mems
    microphone and one Electret (nearest the medical white paper dimensions)
    and move this along.  I was surprised what I found in the dev board stuff here.

    That last Electret board in interesting.  Its intended to be split into four
    parts, three different electret mics and one mems mic.  Might be a good way
    to test.  3 electret mics are: omnidirectional, noise cancelling and
    unidirectional.  The mems mic is omnidirectional.

    If I had to guess, I'd suspect we want unidirectional microphone.  Don't
    really know. It would be fun to test each to understand how each works.

    of these characteristics are:  e.g Frequency Self Resonant (?),
    does moisture protecting rating matter to us?  Would exciters offer us anything?
    (hm.. can we use an exciter as an input device?  I know I've taken cheap speakers and
    used them as microphones and they work. Do exciter speakers offer us anyting?
    Might be worth a call to the engineers at PUI Audio and find out. See also

    https://www.stetron.com/resonant-frequency/
    In the piston range of a driver (before the cone exhibits oscillations other
    than those induced by the motion of the voice coil in the magnet), a loudspeaker
    acts as a high pass filter (HPF). The resonant frequency of a speaker, f0
    (pronounced: F-naught), is the frequency below which a loudspeaker is
    increasingly unable to generate sound output for a given input signal.

    the low end of Self Resonant Frequency, when we prioritize them for low
    frequency output.  Wish i'd seen that before, sigh.

    That paper led me to this 24-page analysis of electronic stethoscopes...  it's
    mostly telehealth related, but they've done some consistent measurements
    across a whole range of different stethoscopes (one costs $2700!), so if we

    Stethoscope Acoustics
        I. The Doctor and His Stethoscope
        By PAUL Y. ERTEL, M.D., MERLE LAWRENCE, PH.D.,
        RICHARD K. BROWN, PH.D., AND AARON M. STERN, M.D.

    -- This paper is generally focused on measuring performance.
    -- "Controversy has long existed as to whether the mechanical stethoscope is
       capable of amplifying sound. Data from both the objective and the subjective
       studies indicate that it can amplify. However, amplification was found to
       be uneven in all instruments in which it did occur. The regularity of
       amplification peaks occuring through the test frequency range suggests that
       these peaks reflect standing waves within the lumen of the stethoscope.
       These occur when the length of a stethoscope matches quarter-wave lengths
       of the sounds passing through it. This results in reinforcement, commonly
       called "resonance peaks." Other factors may be involved, and specific
       studies must be carried out with instruments of constant length before
       this concept can be validated."

    The effects of tubing bore on stethoscope efficiency
    Maurice B.Rappaport, E.E.    Howard B.Sprague, M.D.
    -- Our data showed that below about 100 cycles per second, the efficiency is
       not affected materially by tubing length. From about 100 cycles per second
       to 1,000 cycles per second, tubing length exhibits a considerable effect
       upon stethoscope efficiency; that is, the efficiency decreases with increased
       tubing length. We concluded that the changes in the efficiency of an acoustic
       stethoscope which are caused by varying the length of the tubing, although
       not given any consideration by stethoscope users, produce an effect upon
       the quality of the heart sounds and the ability to hear low-intensity murmurs of
       medium and high frequency. For example, at 200 cycles per second there is a 15
       decibel attenuation of the sounds when two rubber tubes, each 26 inches long
       (commercial stethoscope tubing, with a caliber of 3/16 inch), are substituted for
       two similar tubes 3 inches in length. The sound is about eight times as loud in
       the short tubing system. This attenuation occurs in the region where the lowintensity,
       high-pitched basal diastolic murmurs are present, and every possible
       increase in efficiency in this region is of utmost value.
       Our analysis also indicated that the auscultatory sound
    -- Our analysis also indicated that the auscultatory sound pressure variations
       at the ear, produced by the motion of the skin or Bakelite diaphragm, are inversely
       proportional to the internal volume of the stethoscope, so that an infinitely
       small volume would theoretically exhibit a maximum variation in pressure,
       which, in turn, would manifest itself as a sound of maximum intensity. The
       skin diaphragm effect is produced when the open bell chest piece is placed on the
       surface of the chest, and the Bakelite diaphragm effect is produced by means of
       the Bowles chest piece. Obviously, therefore, the tubing, according to this form
       of reasoning, should be as short as possible and the caliber as small as possible.
       Also, the wall of the tubing should be sufficiently rigid for maximum efficiency,
       for any wall motion reduces the effective pressure variation transmitted to the
       observer’s ear.
    -- We also indicated that a factor that must be taken into consideration is the
       frictional resistance offered to the air column by the walls of the rubber tubing.
       That is, the efficiency of a stethoscope decreases as the resistance to the pressure
       variations is increased; the resistance is increased as the caliber is decreased.
       In eliminating the resistance component, we have still to consider that the greater
       the volume, the less the efficiency.

    Research article on the GilaZ Open Source Stethoscope.

    And the magic words from that paper...

    Numerous groups have previously attempted to standardize methods to determine
    the efficacy of acoustic stethoscope models[2,16–20], but currently no accepted
    standardized modality exists. Consequently, the performance of any acoustic
    stethoscope is little more than the manufacturer’s claim or the subjective
    opinion of the user. Some groups have attempted to objectively compare acoustic
    stethoscope models and currently two competing methods of measuring frequency
    response exist. The first method uses air coupling to transmit frequencies[2–4,16,17]
    while the other uses a phantom to simulate vibrations of the chest wall[19,21,22].
    These methods allow investigators to quantitatively compare the sensitivity
    of a stethoscope model compared with another.

    Acoustic transfer

    The frequency response of Glia model stethoscopes, compared with the Littman
    Cardiology III, was determined using an experimental setup modeled from a
    phantom-based frequency response setup previously described[19]. A latex
    balloon filled with 2 L (2000 g) of water was used as a phantom and each
    stethoscope was applied to the surface by hand. Phantom excitations were
    supplied by an external vibrating speaker which was placed in contact with
    the balloon and sound was played at 86 Hz intervals between 0 and 5000 Hz
    (white noise) for 15 seconds. The output of each stethoscope was recorded by
    a microphone which was placed in a silicon tube attached to the stethoscope
    head for spectral analysis. Spectral analyses such as these have been used
    successfully in the past to analyze breath sounds recorded from individuals
    with lung pathology[40]. The simplicity of this design was intended to allow
    other users to validate our design independently.

    Gosh, I think that means we can obtain a quantifiable measurement between our
    different design proposals.  And that is really great news.  Anybody have an
    exciter speaker (blue tooth box you set on a desk, and the whole desk vibrates
    with your audio output?)

    From: https://github.com/GliaX/Stethoscope/blob/master/testing/Stethoscope_Validation.md
    In the above topology, the balloon contains 2L of water (2000g), acoustic
    input is supplied via a pair of Monster DNA headphones and sounds were
    recorded using a Hama microphone. Audacity was used to create a 15 second
    audio clip of white noise which was played through the setup with the output
    of each stethoscope being recorded for spectral analysis. The spectrum produced
    by each stethoscope model was then compared to that of the Littmann Cardiology
    III. These plots are shown below...

    -- I've found that the diaphragm should have a thickness of around 0.7-0.9 mm
       and should be made of a relatively hard plastic material for optimal
       performance. I ended up using a A4 paper folder from here:

    -- If you can get a hold of X Ray film, that should be about the right thickness
       that was used in the very first stethoscopes. If you have a littmann diaphragm
       available to you, you can cut it and use it as a standard to compare.
    -- as for attaching the membrane, you should be able to just drop it into the
       printed ring and friction-fit the head into it. I haven't seen or encountered
       anything to suggest otherwise.

    -- ...nowhere do I see the diameter of the Diaphragm.  Is it supposed to sit
       inside the lip on the top of the head ?  Does it extend to the inner edge
       of the ring ?  Should it be glued to the lip, or does it need to have some
       play between the lip and the ring ?
    -- Short answer: 40mm diameter. (Apparently early versions had a rubber
       o-ring under the membrane...)

    -- My stethoscope has rounder edges for improved patient comfort, as well as
       easier build plate removal.
    -- I widened the "spring" to reduce clamping pressure in the users ears.
       There are two models of the spring. I'd print the non-tight one first. It
       should be great for most people.
    -- I redesigned the chest piece in two versions.  One that is low profile with
       no supports.  One that adds a finger button to allow it to be easily held
       between the fingers Both chest pieces have rounded sound channels to reduce
       obstructions for better sound transfer.
    -- Diaphragm: 40mm diameter cut from a report cover with approx 0.35mm plastic sheet
    -- I have designed the chest piece so that the membrane (report cover) is
       held in place by pressure from the TOP and BOTTOM, NOT the sides! Make sure
       that when you cut the diaphragm out, it drops in to the ring without forcing
       it in. If you force it, it will per-tension the diaphragm and reduce it's
       sensitivity. It should drop in to the ring and then the ring gets squeezed
       down on to the chest piece. The diaphragm should lay completely flat with
       no bulges at all.

        Table 3-1 provides the parameters: k1 = 0.1592 and k2 = 0.586. Arbitrarily
        selecting R1 = 10K and C = 0.01uF (common values for op amp circuits), R
        and Rf can be calculated as 15.95K and 5.86K, respectively. Rounding
        these last two values to the nearest 1% standard resistors, results in
        R = 15.8K and Rf = 5.90K All of the components should be 1% precision or
        better.

        The particular op amp use isn't critical, as long as the unity gain frequency
        is more than 30 to 100 times higher than the filter's cutoff frequency.
        This is an easy requirement as long as the filter's cutoff frequency is
        below about 100 kHz.

    Q-Factor
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor
        Q factor is a dimensionless parameter that describes how underdamped an
        oscillator or resonator is. It is defined as the ratio of the peak energy
        stored in the resonator in a cycle of oscillation to the energy lost per
        radian of the cycle.  Higher Q indicates a lower rate of energy loss and
        the oscillations die out more slowly. A pendulum suspended from a
        high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high Q, while a pendulum
        immersed in oil has a low one. Resonators with high quality factors have
        low damping, so that they ring or vibrate longer.

        For an electrically resonant system, the Q factor represents the effect
        of electrical resistance.

    http://www.tedpavlic.com/teaching/osu/ece327/lab7_proj/lab7_proj_procedure.pdf
        good notes within this document
        As you will see, Butterworth filters have maximally flat amplitude response
        in the passband. Unfortunately, they have two major drawbacks.
        --Poor Roll-off: Butterworth high-frequency roll-off is shallow, which means
          that high-frequency signals are not greatly attenuated. To remedy this,
          our power amplifier has provide an additional high-frequency pole.
        --Poor Phase Response: Butterworth low-pass filters have extremely poor
          phase response near the corner frequency. The non-linear phase response
          delays some frequencies more than others. The result is that inputs with
          significant high-frequency components are distorted on the output because
          their higher-frequency components are re-combined out of phase.
        Together, fast inputs to your circuit may be significantly distorted after
        smoothing.

    Reminder:
        y = log-base-a (x)
        So that --> a^y = x

        e.g.
        log-base-10(10^7) = 7

    If we want a total voltage gain of 100..

    current Adafruit amp max = 18db = 20Log-base-10 (Vout/Vin)
    Vout/Vin ==> 7.94
    current Adafruit amp max = 15db = 20Log-base-10 (Vout/Vin)
    Vout/Vin ==> 5.62


    We want 100!     100/7.94 = 12.6        100/5.62 = 17.8
    db = 20 Log-base-10(12.6) = 22db
    (i.e. we need this much pre-amp gain to get V/V Gain of 100)
    18db + 22db = 40db
    db = 20 Log-base-10(17.8) = 25db
    18db + 25db = 43db

    Can we get a multiple stage Sallen-Key filter to provide 22db of gain at the
    input to the audio amp?

    OpAmp Slew Rate?
        https://forum.digikey.com/t/suitable-slew-rate-in-op-amp-circuit-design/641
        Slew rate reflects the output voltage conversion rate of the Op amp. In
        other words, it shows how fast the Op amp can respond to a rapid change
        of input level.

    Here's an interesting dev board from digikey.
