    I really, really like Scheme-it for schematics.

    https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/schemeit
    Way easy to share electronic design schematics.  Here is a recent project, that I
     started for a recent Hackathon challenge.

     Digikey saves everything the cloud for you, makes it way easy.
     Would we consider using such a tool. allows multiple folks to make changes...

    To draw simple boxes, use "Diagram Symbols" --> "Basic Shapes"
    To draw simple text labels, use "Diagram Symbols" --> "Basic Shapes"
    To add a full featured Text Box, use Top "Main" Tab, then select "Insert" --> "TextBox"
    To add wiring touch points, use... "Schematic Symbols"--> "Ports"
