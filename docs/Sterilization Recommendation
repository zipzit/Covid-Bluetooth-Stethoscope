Chemicals:
  Ethylene Oxide
    a.k.a. EtO or EO

    Here is a link about electronic sterilization using EtO/EO or ethylene oxide: https://www.steris-ast.com/techtip/considerations-eo-processing-devices-containing-electronic-components/
    It has a checklist that determines if a device should or should not go through EO sterilization.

  EtO gas presents the danger of ignition. Probably a no-go.
From Harry Thaman: "I know that 70% EtOH in water and low percent H2O2 in water (I forget what exactly but can look it up) both sterilize effectively.
Dry heat can also work if it penetrates effectively but I don't know if your device is robust against any of those
Another option might be a ziplock bag of some sort so the device is never exposed to a patient or visa versa

Dry heat can also work if it penetrates effectively but I don't know if your device is robust against any of those"

### Methods ###
Electronics
For electronics such as cell phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, and keyboards, remove 
visible contamination if present.

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.

Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics.

If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing 
at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.
