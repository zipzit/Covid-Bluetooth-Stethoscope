### Description ###
 
I am a frontline physician (hospitalist) that is seeing increasing volumes of patients at our facilities. PPE supplies are becoming increasingly precious and we expect we will need to mitigate PPE and equipment waste and develop new options for protection of our healthcare workforce.

One major item that is not discussed regularly on the news are disposable stethoscopes and pulse oximetry. In resource-rich countries, a patient on contact isolation will have a dedicated "disposable" stethoscope during their hospital admission. These are typically poor quality and of limited utility. They are also quite short -- resulting in close physical proximity to an ill patient, which increases risk of droplet contamination on PPE and individuals.

Additionally, continuous or episodic use of pulse oximetry (measuring oxygen level in the blood) is another common tool we will need in droves. As with other supplies and equipment, I expect need will vastly outstrip supply due to the lack of machines and need to clean these items between patients.

I am asking all the talented people on this forum to help design an (1) inexpensive (2) Bluetooth-enabled stethoscope bell with pulse oximetry [if possible] to reduce very-close proximity exposure for healthcare workers and enhance existing supplies chains for this medical equipment. I would prefer any designs be made widely available for any manufacturer to use if they agree to donate 90% of proceeds to medical relief organizations.

### Who is already working on this ###

Existing companies produce electronic stethoscopes, though none natively broadcast to Bluetooth headphones. No stethoscope includes pulse oximetry.
